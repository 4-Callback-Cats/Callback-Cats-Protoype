### Project Name


## About the Project:
Are you overwhelmed and anxious about the boost of community based courses and get into FOMO of others achievements?
Worry not! 
Groups can get a little overwhelming, but how bout, having to study/learn/upskill yourself with a like minded companion?

Comapanionsy is a web app which will help you find a study partner, according to YOUR capabilities and who is at a similar level as yours.
Once you find a great study partner, you both can learn and grow together while having fun simultaneously.

Simply login with your Google account and answer a few simple questions which will help us find a perfect match for you.

Interesting right? Dive in then!
