## About the Project:
Are you overwhelmed and anxious about the boost of community based courses and get into FOMO of others achievements?
Worry not! 
Groups can get a little overwhelming, but how bout, having to study/learn/upskill yourself with a like minded companion?

Comapanionsy is a web app which will help you find a study partner, according to YOUR capabilities and who is at a similar level as yours.
Once you find a great study partner, you both can learn and grow together while having fun simultaneously.

Simply login with your Google account and answer a few simple questions which will help us find a perfect match for you.

Interesting right? Dive in then!

## Flow of the app

The user lands on the landing page. Reads about the product and heads over to sign Up.
After signing in through google auth, the user is asked a few questions to let us find a good match.
After he answers the questions, he is redirected to the `feed` page, where he 
can choose among the available profiles.

Currently, we are saving all the userData in the firebase database. But facing an issue in fetching and rendering the data. 
Therefore using dummy data.

The matching of profiles will be based on matches in the answer, the implementation of which wasn't possible due to lack of time.

We further plan to provide popular resources to learn according to the skills they want to learn.
